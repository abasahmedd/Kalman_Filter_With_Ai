**"AI-Driven Signal Filtering for Enhanced Kalman Filter Performance in High-Noise Environments"**



## üß† Abstract
This study explores the integration of artificial intelligence models with the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) to improve signal estimation in high-noise environments such as UAV applications using IMU data. Multiple AI models (ANN, LSTM, GRU, BiLSTM, Fuzzy Logic) were tested to adaptively tune the Kalman filter, significantly reducing estimation error.

## üéØ Objectives
- Apply EKF on real IMU data
- Combine EKF with AI models (ANN, GRU, LSTM, etc.)
- Compare estimation accuracy using RMSE & MSE
- Evaluate computational complexity and real-time feasibility

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology
1. Collect real IMU data (accelerometer & gyroscope)
2. Apply EKF and enhanced versions using:
   - Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)
   - Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN, LSTM, GRU)
   - Fuzzy Logic
3. Compare models using RMSE, MSE, and processing time
